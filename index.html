						# Learn DynamoDB Fast and Hard
						By: Christopher Nyberg / [NewMountain](https://github.com/NewMountain)

						# Level Set

						--

						## What is a "fast and hard" presentation?

						--
						
						### Inspired by the exceptional [Learn Haskell Fast and Hard](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-the-Hard-Way/) by Yann Esposito

						--

						### Designed to briefly introduce everything you will need to know in a real production environment

						--

						### Not designed to teach!

						#### Designed to _introduce_ you to everything you should know and expose gaps in your current knowledge

						--
						
						### Success critera
						
						* The next time you work with DynamoDB, you have a page of contents for what you need to dive deep on when the need arises
						* You will, hopefully, never be blindsided unexpectedly

						---

						## Typical AWS Documentation

						![How to Draw an Owl Meme (Step One, a circle. Step 2, an exquisite photo-accurate owl drawing.)](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/572/078/d6d.jpg)

						--

						## Zen Master Wisdom

						* Most AWS documentation is actually marketing material.
						* You, the developer, are the customer.
						* Your confidence is their sale.

						![The Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1679/4787/files/7pex59h04bp41_600x600.jpg?v=1610906095)

						--

						## How this typically works

						* Starting documentation is designed to give you (false) confidence: draw the circle
						* Product testimonials running Amazon shopping cart or Lyft's global dispatching: the finished owl
						* You scouring stack overflow, clicking between two unhelpful AWS pages linking to each other, giving up and reading source code, and having an emotional breakdown at your monitor while getting a SEV2 page: all the actual steps in between

						--

						## My Hope for this presentation

						* A less brutal outline of those steps between the circle and the owl

						---

						# What is a DynamoDB

						* Key Value Store
						* Wide Column Database
						* Legitimately massive scale
						* Legitimately Millisecond response times
						* Connections over HTTP
						* Amazon's operational burden, not yours

						--

						## Physical Intuition

						---

						# TL; DR

						* We specialize for scale and speed
						
						![O1 Keanu Meme](presentation/o1_keanu.png)

						---

						# Dynamo Concepts

						--

						## Tables

						* A collection of items
						* Each item must have at least one index
						* Each item may optionally have many additional indexes (GSIs and LSIs)
						* There is no practical limit on table size
						* 40,000 Read and Write Request Units (per second)

						--

						## Item

						* A collection of attributes
						* Only constraint is the item must adhere to index constraints
						* Think of it as a "document" or JSON with some extra features
						* 400 KB per item size limit

						--

						## Attributes

						* Scalar Types
						  * Number
						  * String
						  * Binary
						  * Boolean
						  * Null
						* Nested Types
						  * Sets
						  * Lists
						  * Maps

						--

						## Indexes

						* Partition (Hash) Key
						* Sort (Range) Key
						* Simple Primary Key (parition only)
						* Composite Primary Key (partition and sort)
						* Must be unique (though components of composite key need not be)
						* Global Secondary Indexes are great - use them a lot
						* Local Secondary Indexes suck - basically never use them

						--

						## Streams

						* The ability to "tail" your database
						* On each operation (insert, update delete) a record will be sent to either Lambda or Kinesis

						--

						## Backups

						* Several options exist
						* Each option has awkward compromises, no obvious option for all use cases
						* Is affected by choice of replication strategy

						--

						## Replication

						* Global tables or Replication from backups

						--

						## TTL (Time to Live)

						* The Time To Live can be set per table
						* Automatic way to evict old data from a table
						* Needs to be Unix Epoch **in seconds** _as a number_
						* Runs as background process per partition
						* Amazon only guarantees 48 hour SLA
						* Personal experience: they are typically within a few minutes
						* Weird edge cases
						  * String attributes are silently ignored
						  * Epoch times more than five years ago are assumed to be user error and not evicted
						* TL; DR: Use it, don't rely on it (use query constraints instead)

						--

						## Item Collections and Partitions

						* Each key is a partition and an item collection
						* These two entities are the real things to pay attention to
						* Partitions can be primary or secondary
						* All writes must go to primary
						* All _consistent_ reads must come from primary
						* Writes are committed to primary and _one_ secondary before response
						* Write is commitedd to second secondary single digit second(s) later

						--

						## Read and Write Capacity Units

						* DyanmoDB pricing is determined (mostly) by RCU and WCU
						* Two modes of provisioning RCUs and WCUs (Provisioned and On-Demand)

						--

						## NoSql Data Modeling

						* Take a deep breath and forget SQL for now
						* Some concepts here will be alien, uncomfortable or even seem "wrong"
						* Generally: schema is on write, and work is done up-front to reduce work later

						--

						## Migrations

						* Generally left to the user
						* Benefit greatly from parallel scans
						* Level of downtime will determine the difficulty

						---

						# Deep Dive on Capacity Units and Billing

						--

						## Read Capacity Unit

						* Any read operation
						* Billed in 4KB increments (rounded up)
						* The total KB is based on the total size of the item read (not just index)
						* Scan operations will read every item in a table!!!
						* One RCU (Read Capacity unit) is 4KB of _strongly consistent_ read operation
						* An _eventually consistent read_ of 4KB only counts as half an RCU
						* A _transactional read_ is charged double, so a _transactional_ 4KB read is 2 RCU
						* Calculated per request

						--

						## Write Capacity Unit

						* Any Write Operation
						* Billed in 1KB increments (rounded up)
						* The KB sizing is based on the total size of the item written
						* One WCU (Write Capacity Unit) is 1KB of written data
						* A _transactional write_ is charged double, so a _transactional_ write of 1KB is 2 WCU
						* Calculated per request

						--

						## On Demand Provisioning

						* Generally the more popular option
						* More expensive (roughly 7x more than provisioned [at full capacity])
						* No need to estimate levels, just make it Amazon's problem
						* Scale from trivial to bananas (assuming good access design)
						* No waste for unused capacity
						* Consistent from heavy use to sparse use, even in bursty workloads

						--

						## Provisioned Capacity

						* Can be cheaper if your workloads are consistent and predictable
						* Provision RCUs and WCUs independently
						* Paid for on an hourly basis
						* Unused capacity does not carry over
						* Auto-scaling is an option but is slow to scale (usually responds in order of minutes)
						* You can only switched between On-Demand and Provisioned once a day

						--

						# Other expenses

						* Storage costs are generally $0.25 per GB per month
						* Point In Time Recovery adds additional costs
						* DynamoDB streams add additional costs (based on retreiving items from change stream)

						--
						
						## Billing TL; DR

						* Unless traffic is very consistent, predictable, even or changes slowly
						* _and_ if the client is comfortable with the risk of potential throttling
						* _and_ the client is very cost sensitive
						* then use provisioned capacity
						* In all other circumstances, just On-Demand capacity
						* Caveat: unless you're at huge scales where the two converge at an upper TPS limit
						
						--

						## AWS anti-patterns warning

						* A client may focus lots of time and effort on reducing a Dynamo bill by picking the "right" capacity mode
						* You can save, easily, far more by optimizing access patterns and usage by effective modeling instead
						* Better optimizations:
						  * Eliminate scans
						  * Confirm you need transactions
						  * Audit the efficiency of reads
						  * Make sure all the data being read needs to be in the table
						  * At scale: shorten attribute names

						---

						# Partitions and Item Collections

						* 3000 RCU and 1000 WCU per partition per second
						* 10GB per partition limit (partition split beyond that)
						* An item collection holds up to 10GB
						* If the item collection exceeds 10GB, it is split across partitions
						* Partitions typically are the source of throttling
						* Can be hard to debug throttling partitions

						---

						# Discussion of API

						--

						## Queries

						* An operation to affect a list of items
						* Affects 0 or more items
						* Can only be done on an index
						* Allows the index to only be partially specified (part of a composite key)
						* Allows Read or Write Operations by Query
						* Can apply filters on the results of the query
						* Response size can be reduced with projections

						--

						## Scans

						* An operations to affect a list of items
						* Affects 0 or more items
						* Can be done on any attribute across all items in a table
						* Will apply one or more filters to all items in the table
						  * Contains/Does not Contain
						  * Null/Not Null
						  * `>, >=, ==, <=, <, !=`
						  * etc

						--

						## Scans (continued)

						* Allows read or write operations
						* Massively expensive
						* Very slow as dynamo must perform enormous scatter/gather operations
						* The use of the API in basically any context is strongly discouraged

						--

						## Item-Specific Operations

						* An operation to affect a single item
						* Affects 0 or 1 item
						* Can only be done on an index
						* The index must be fully specified
						* Write or Read an item

						---

						# API Discussion from the trenches

						* Pagination kind of sucks, but is necessary evil
						* Odd LastEvaluationKey/ExclusiveStartKey syntax
						* Single item <= 400KB
						* 1 MB limit in a single request
						* Discussions of Filters, Projections, Conditions and Sort Key
						* Atomic Operations

						--

						## Bulk API Discussion

						* Bulk Read
						  * 16MB response size limit
						  * 100 item limit
						  * My advice: set batch size to 40 (16MB / 400KB max item size)
						* Bulk Write
						  * 16 MB request size limit
						  * 25 Put or Delete requests
						  * My advice: set batch size to 25
						* Crazy gotcha: Duplicate items in a bulk request is an immediate throwing error!!!

						# Data Modeling 
						
						--

						## 100 Scoville

						* Attributes
						* Sets
						* Basically storing simple json

						--

						## 3,000 Scoville

						* Nested Data Types
						  * Put just the attributes of the child you need in the parent
						  * Ideally, those attributes should be immutable
						* Basic Denormalization
						  * Put a list of IDs you can batch get from the index "shallow deduplication"

						--

						## 50,000 Scoville
						
						* Pre Joined Data
						  * Put the entire child document as an attribute in the parent
						  * If reverse lookup necessary, store parent in child and child in parent
						* Store redundant information so it's guaranteed to be in any response
						* Query on secondary indexes
						  * Access data in a reverse lookup
						* Ascending vs Descending operations on sort key
						  * Use `ScanIndexForward` and `ScanIndexForward=False` for highest x or lowest x results

						--

						## 300,000 Scoville

						* PK / SK Table Design
						  * Intentionally overload and keep multiple entities in a single index
						  * Store simple and complex lookups on the same partition key to return several data types
						* Sparse Indexes
						  * Intentionally not writing data into an index to increase query specificity
						* Store adjadency lists (in same or separate table)
						* Application joins

						--

						## 2 million Scoville 1 of 2

						* Overloaded Indexes
						  * Overload sort key to store heirarchical data or data at mulitple levels of heirarchy
						* Materialize a Graph
						  * Store a partial of complete key with attributes describing vertexes to other nodes and their relationship
						* Composite Sort Keys
						  * Define multiple ordered elements into a single sort key to allow efficient filtering
						
						--

						## 2 million Scoville 2 of 2
						
						* Double Sided Data Access
						  * Break a sort key into three sets to further optimize cardinality and speed (think of quicksort LT, E, GT for intuition)
						* Set algebra
						  * Given the difference/intersection/union of the keys of these two queries...

						--

						## After death

						* Just use streams to put it in another datastore...man.
						* Gotcha: Sorts are ordered Lexigraphically by UTF-8 bytes (mind casing!)

						# Fun edge cases

						* Leverage scatter (tables) and gather (queries) for super "hot" partitions
						  * Example: Running the US Election Counter on Dynamo

						---

						# Backups

						--

						## Point in Time Recovery (PITR)
						
						* (+) Stores all db changes for 35 days
						* (+) Recover to any point in the last 35 days
						* (+) No Performance Penalty
						* (-) No longer term solution

						--

						## AWS Backup Service

						* (+) Integrated with DynamoDB
						* (+) Centrlized and fully automated
						* (+) AWS Managed Service
						* (+) Supports most Database services
						* (+) The backup can be restored to another region
						* (=) Creates a backup vault in the same region as the table
						* (-) The backup cannot be interacted with
						* (-) The backup cannot be replicated to other regions
						* (-) The backups cannot be pushed to a different region

						--

						## On Demand Backups (EMR)

						* (+) Super fast
						* (+) Can handle just about any scale
						* (+) Dumps S3 where you can inspect and interact with it
						* (+) Can be replicated via S3 replication
						* (+) File type contains type information to recreate Dynamo table from backup itself
						* (=) Creates an EMR cluster
						* (-) Files hard to read/reason about (super HDFS-ey)
						* (-) Restores using EMR are super finickey
						* (-) Any operation requires the recreation of the EMR cluster (slow) or keeping it around (expensive)
						* (-) Counts against your DDB RCUs

						--

						## On Demand Backups (S3)
						
						* (+) Very easy to read/reason about data (Newline separated JSON!)
						* (+) Super easy to do (click button or single AWS CLI command)
						* (+) No infra required
						* (+) Dumps S3 where you can inspect and interact with it
						* (+) Does not count against your RCUs
						* (+) Can be replicated via S3 replication
						* (-) Less fast than EMR backups
						* (-) Required PITR to be enabled to run
						* (-) Does not contain the data required to recreate the table

						---

						# Streams

						--

						## The Good

						* 24 hour stream retention
						* Shards correspond 1-1 to partitions
						* Fast and no load on table
						* Concurrency is defined per shard
						* Near real-time triggering at any scale
						* That record can be:
						  * The key that changed
						  * The new value of the item
						  * The old value of the item
						  * The new and old value of the item (generally, you want this)
						* You can enable a DLQ for problematic messages (not default behavior)
						* Can trigger a lambda or be sent to Kinesis

						--

						## The Bad

						* By default, the stream will block until the message is successfully processed
						* Bugs in your lambda code can be devastating and, if unaddressed, will cause data loss
						* BE SUPER MINDFUL OF `starting_position` on `event_source_mapping`
						  * `TRIM_HORIZON` - Oldest record in shard (24 hours ago)
						  * `LATEST` - Records start when deployed

						--

						## The Ugly

						* If a message is put in DLQ, it is not the same as the message that lamda receives
						  * A lambda receives the record, but a pointer to a stream is put into the DLQ
						  * The pointer only lives 24 hours (vs the DLQ up to 7 days)
						  * Getting the record the lambda receives from the stream pointer is astonishingly difficult

						---

						# Migrations

						* Parallel Scans are your friend
						* If you want zero downtime migrations, you will need DDB streams
						* Generally easier to modify in place

						---

						# Global Tables

						* For truly global scale operations, resiliency, and availability
						* Implemented as regional tables broadcasting all changes to all other regions
						* Solve a problem by creating more! 
						  * Idempotency
						  * (de)duplication
						  * other infra replication/coordination

						---

						# Where to go from here?

						* Read Dynamo Documentation Critically
						* Do things yourself using CLI/Console/SDK
						* Read Alex DeBrie (he's great!)
