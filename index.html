						# Learn DynamoDB Fast and Hard
						By: Christopher Nyberg / [NewMountain](https://github.com/NewMountain)

						# Level Set

						## What is a "fast and hard" presentation?

						--
						
						### Inspired by the exceptional [Learn Haskell Fast and Hard](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-the-Hard-Way/) by Yann Esposito

						--

						### Designed to briefly introduce everything you will need to know in a real production environment

						--

						### Not designed to teach!

						#### Designed to _introduce_ you to everything you should know and expose gaps in your current knowledge

						--
						
						### Success critera
						
						* The next time you work with DynamoDB, you have a page of contents for what you need to dive deep on when the need arises
						* You will, hopefully, never be blindsided unexpectedly

						---

                        # Hot Take

						## Typical AWS Documentation

						![How to Draw an Owl Meme (Step One, a circle. Step 2, an exquisite photo-accurate owl drawing.)](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/572/078/d6d.jpg)

						--

						## Zen Master Wisdom

						* Most AWS documentation is actually marketing material.
						* You, the developer, are the customer.
						* Your confidence is their sale.

						![The Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1679/4787/files/7pex59h04bp41_600x600.jpg?v=1610906095)

						--

						## How this typically works

						* Starting documentation is designed to give you (false) confidence: draw the circle
						* Product testimonials running Amazon shopping cart or Lyft's global dispatching: the finished owl
						* You scouring stack overflow, clicking between two unhelpful AWS pages linking to each other, giving up and reading source code, and having an emotional breakdown at your monitor while getting a SEV2 page: all the actual steps in between

						--

						## My Hope for this presentation

						* A less brutal outline of those steps between the circle and the owl

						---

						# What is a DynamoDB

						* Key Value Store
						* Wide Column Database
						* Legitimately massive scale
						* Legitimately Millisecond response times
						* Connections over HTTP
						* Amazon's operational burden, not yours

						---

						# TL; DR

						* We specialize for scale and speed

						# Dynamo Concepts

						* Table
						* Item
						* Attributes
						* Datatypes
						* Keys
						* Indexes
						* Partitions
						* Streams
						* Backups
						* Replication
						* TTL
						* Item Collection
						* Read and Write Capacity Units
						* NoSQL Modeling
						* Backups
						* Migrations

						---

						# Physical Implementation

						* Region
						* Hashing Function
						* Data distribution and AZs
						* Primary Node
						* Two Secondary Nodes
						* Regional vs Global Table tradeoffs
						* Discussion of consistent reads

						---

						# Partitions (the core concept everyone misses)

						* 3000 RCU and 1000 WCU per partition per second
						* 10GB per partition limit (partition split beyond that)
						* 

						---

						# Discussion of API

						* Queries
						* Scans (Just say no)
						* Item-specific operations

						---

						# API Discussion from the trenches

						* Pagination kind of sucks, but is necessary evil
						* Odd LastEvaluationKey/ExclusiveStartKey syntax
						* Single item <= 400KB
						* 1 MB response limit
						* Bulk Read:
						* Bulk Write:
						* Discussions of Filters, Projections, Conditions and Sort Key
						* Atomic Operations

						---

						# Deep Dive on Capacity Units

						---

						# Repeat after me

						NO CODING UNTIL YOU KNOW YOUR ACCESS PATTERNS

						---

						# Data Modeling 
						
						-- 

						## 100 Scoville

						* Attributes
						* Sets

						--

						## 3,000 Scoville

						* Nested Data Types
						* Basic Denormalization

						--

						## 50,000 Scoville

						* PK / SK Table Design
						* Pre Joined Data
						* Overloaded Indexes
						* Numerous GSIs

						--

						## 300,000 Scoville

						* One-To-Many Modeling
						* Sparse Indexes

						--

						## Carolina Reaper (2 million Scoville)

						* Many-To-Many Modeling
						* Double Sided Data Access

						--

						## After death

						* Just use streams to put it in another datastore...man.

						---

						# Backups

						* PITR
						* On Demand Backups
						* Restores

						---

						# Streams

						* Generally awesome
						* Up to 7 day retention
						* Fast and no load on table
						* Discussion of shards
						* ...until you get bad data
						* Stream blocking, data loss or DLQ
						* DLQ DDB steam type madness
						* 

						---

						# Migrations

						* Parallel Scans are your friend

						---

						# Global Tables

						* For truly global scale operations, resiliency, and availability
						* Solve a problem by creating more! 
						  * Idempotency
						  * (de)duplication
						  * other infra replication/coordination
